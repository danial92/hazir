in order to have the same importing system in backend like in the frontend e.g import something from 'something', we need following line to be added in package.json file
"type": "module",   ---> it should be added below "main": "index.js",



Constants (khaali dabbay) --> reducer (factory) + action (machines of factory used to prepare the product) --> store.js (normal store in market)

It is imp for us to install dotenv and write a code for it in app.js in order to make the .env file work
